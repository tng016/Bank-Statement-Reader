===== Bank-Statement-Reader =====

Created: September 2016

Status: Incomplete

I have long searched for a tool to track my personal spending and perform analysis on my spending habits. In the end I decided to create my own tool.

This program will read my bank e-statements using the apache PDFbox and extract out my transaction details. It can then tell me how much I spent this week/month/year and what did i spend it on.

The program will also be able to read statements from my different bank accounts.
